# Sound

## Music
The music of Free the Forest aims to utilise folk instrumentation to evoke a sense of austerity, resourcefulness, and the great outdoors.
The musical themes already introduced can be reinterpreted using electronic instrumentation if required.
Audio for the overworld map is a simple backdrop of wind and forest sounds. This gives the player a sense of respite between battle sequences.

## SFX
In terms of sound effects, these are simple and recognisable sounds. 
 - The sound of a deck shuffling
 - a card being peeled from a deck
 - a firm thwack for an attack
 - a metallic clink for defense
