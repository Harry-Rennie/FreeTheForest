For the music of Free the Forest we are utilising folk instrumentation to evoke a sense of austerity, resourcefulness, and the great outdoors. However, if the story requires it, the musical themes already introduced can be reinterpreted using electronic instrumentation.
The Overworld audio should be a simple backdrop of wind and forest sounds. This will give the player a sense of respite between the battle sequences.
In terms of sound effects, these should be simple and recognisable sounds. The sound of a deck shuffling; a card being peeled from a deck; a firm thwack for an attack; a metallic clink for defense. These effects are probably freely available.
